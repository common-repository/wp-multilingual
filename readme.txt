MySQL database issues

You will need to check which character set your database is set to before you proceed. Almost 99% of hosting services that provide MySQL set the default language to Latin. Before you proceed you will need to change this to UTF-8. Not doing so will prevent your chosen character set from displaying and saving correctly. You can check your character set using PhpMyAdmin ( http://phpmyadmin.net ). If your database is set to UTF-8 then you can proceed, otherwise you will need to follow the step below.
